Enables you to report the plugins that you're using as working or broken, all from within your WordPress admin.

== Description ==

Plugin Compatibility Reporter enables you report if the plugins that you're using are working properly with your version of WordPress. It integrates with the compatibility reporting features of the official WordPress.org plugin directory, and lets you mark plugins as "working" or "broken" from within your WordPress dashboard.

It also tracks how long each plugin has been active on your site and automatically reports plugins that have been active for a while as compatible (unless, of course, you've already marked them as broken). This way you won't need to waste time on reporting plugins that work fine.

You can configure the time required for a plugin to be considered compatible "by default". You can also change the automatically submitted report at any time, like if turns out that one of your active plugins had a subtle bug that you didn't notice at first.
